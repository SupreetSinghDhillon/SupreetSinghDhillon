# 👋 Hi, I'm Supreet Dhillon

I'm an AI Engineer and recent Computing Science graduate from Simon Fraser University, passionate about building production-grade systems that solve real-world problems using large language models and edge-first AI architectures.

### 🔍 Core Focus

- 🧠 **Agentic AI Systems** — LLM orchestration, LangChain + LangGraph, prompt routing, fallback logic
- 🔒 **Privacy-First Architectures** — On-device semantic search, local vector stores, zero-trust design
- 🤖 **Open-Source Model Integration** — Experience with Mistral, LLaMA, Ollama, OpenAI, and Gemini APIs
- 🛠 **Infrastructure** — Python, Azure Functions, React, Docker, Kubernetes, SQL, CI/CD

### 🚀 Projects

- **🔗 [LoadMinds](https://loadminds.com)**  
  AI dispatcher for trucking. Built from scratch using LangGraph and deployed in production to automate customs, quoting, and invoicing—acquired by MG Transport Ltd.

- **⚖️ LegalEase**  
  A legal tech platform combining LLMs (OpenAI + Gemini) with human-in-the-loop validation. Built a full-stack system with privacy-first architecture and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

- **🖼 PixIndexer**  
  AI-powered mobile app for semantic photo retrieval using vague prompts like “that party with blue lights.” Leveraged LangChain + on-device vector DBs to enable private, offline search.

- **🧠 Arsenal Match Predictor**  
  Machine learning script to forecast Arsenal FC match outcomes using scikit-learn and real match data.

- **🌍 Cradle**  
  Healthcare web app for Uganda developed under Dr. Brian Fraser (SFU). Enabled online patient visits and secure health record management.

### 💡 Philosophy

I'm driven by a desire to make AI useful, safe, and accessible. Every project I build starts with a real-world pain point—and ends with a working product that someone actually uses. I focus on fast iteration, robust design, and systems that scale.
